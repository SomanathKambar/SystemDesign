# System Design Learning Monorepo

This repository acts as a monorepo for tracking my System Design learning journey. It contains multiple independent projects, proofs of concept, and documentation.

## Structure

- **projects/**: Contains independent implementation projects. Each project should have its own README and dependency management (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
- **docs/**: General system design notes, diagrams, and theoretical concepts.
- **resources/**: Shared resources, papers, or reference materials.

## Projects

*(List of projects will be added here)*

## How to use

Since these are independent projects, please refer to the specific project's `README.md` for build and run instructions.
